Preliminary work for a proposed geovisualization project.

Rebecca Zorach is working on a project to catalog murals around the city of chicago.
She would like to create a catalog of images of each mural along with some
meta data about each mural (artist, date of creation, location in the city,
etc).

See the [data sample](data-sample) directory for details.

See the [demos](demos.md) page for various examples of mapping visualizations that enable you to filter place markers on a map based on one or more attributes associated with the markers.
