# Chicago Murals Demo

This branch contains the source files for an early-stage demo of the Chicago Murals project. Map markers indicate a mural location and show a sample mural image when clicked.

See [live demo](http://rcc-uchicago.github.io/murals/).


## Data

* [`murals.geojson`](geojson/murals.geojson) contains mural locations..
* [`areas.geojson`](geojson/areas.geojson) is based on source data coming from the city of Chicago's [data portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6) and [converted](https://github.com/mapbox/togeojson) into `geojson`
